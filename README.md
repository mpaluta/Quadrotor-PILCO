# pilcoV0.9
Matlab code to run PILCO on quadrotor simulation

## Example

The algorithm begins by performing a series of random rollouts. The quadrotor starts in a random initial position and takes random actions.

The policy search observes these dynamics and begins to converge toward a stabilizing policy.

## Instructions

This repo includes the original PILCO files as found on http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/pilco/ as well as three new scenarios: "twinrotor1", "twinrotor2", and "quadrotor".  These can be found in "pilcoV0.9\scenarios\".  To run policy search on the full quadrotor scenario, run the file "quadrotor_learn".  The "settings_q" file can be used to change parameters.

To just analyze a controller, use "analyze_controller".  Two existing data files have been saved: "10Hz.mat" and "20Hz.mat".  These two files can be used for controller analysis as outlined in the procedure of "QuadrotorPILCOreport.pdf" or a new controller can be generated by running the policy search as outlined above.

Questions about the twinrotor and quadrotor scenarios specifically can be sent to markpaluta@gmail.com
