pilcoV0.9
Matlab code to run PILCO on quadrotor simulation

This upload includes the original PILCO files as found on http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/pilco/ as well as three new scenarios: "twinrotor1", "twinrotor2", and "quadrotor". These can be found in "pilcoV0.9\scenarios\". To run the full quadrotor scenario, run the file "quadrotor_learn". The "settings_q" file can be used to change parameters.

To just analyze a controller, use "analyze_controller". Two existing data files have been saved: "10Hz.mat" and "20Hz.mat". These two files can be used for controller analysis as outlined in the procedure of "QuadrotorPILCOreport.pdf" or a new controller can be generated by running the full scenario as described above.

Questions about the twinrotor and quadrotor scenarios specifically can be sent to markpaluta@gmail.com
